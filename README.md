# My dotfiles

These are my personal [dotfiles](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles). This repository helps me 
keep a reproducible version of my development environment, configuration files, system preferences, and 
even my desktop applications.

I keep a step-by-step guide in this README on how to get from a fresh macOS installation to a fully-setup 
working and development environment. From setting up my zsh shell and various CLI tools, to installing my 
desktop apps, to migrating configuration files and updating the default macOS preferences... these steps
are all automated (and reproducible) through shell scripts.

## Fresh macOS Install (a step-by-step guide)


### Clone this repository
Clone this repository under `~/.dotfiles`
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && \
  cd ~/.dotfiles
```


### Setup development environment

#### Install Xcode and Command Line Developer Tools
1. Start by downloading Xcode from the App Store. Once this download is complete, run the following shell 
commands from the Terminal app.
1. Here, we will install the Command Line Developer Tools. The first command ensures `xcode-select` is 
pointing to the correct (active) developer directory. Follow the installation steps that will open in a user 
interface dialog and proceed to the next step.
    ```shell script
    sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer && \
      xcode-select --install
    ```
1. As a final step, you'll need to accept the Xcode and SDK license agreements. The second command will also
install any missing packages.
    ```shell script
    sudo xcodebuild -license accept && \
       sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
    ```

##### Install any pending software updates
We'll now install any pending software updates for your machine. **Note that, if needed, this command will 
automatically restart your machine!**
```shell script
sudo softwareupdate --install --all --verbose --force --restart
```

#### Install Homebrew (brew)
From here on out we will use Homebrew (`brew`) as the go-to package manager for macOS.
```shell script
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)" && \
  brew update && brew upgrade
```

#### Install a better terminal emulator (iTerm2)
After installing iTerm2, you can switch to using the iTerm2 terminal emulator as opposed to Apple's Terminal 
app. _[Todo: Add a note here explaining why `killall cfprefsd` is needed!]_
```shell script
brew cask install iterm2
killall cfprefsd
# Migrate iTerm settings
cp settings/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/Library/Preferences
# Download Shell Integration script
curl -L https://iterm2.com/shell_integration/zsh -o ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh
```
Other terminal emulators to consider:
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - A cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator

#### Upgrade and configure shells
This script will install and configure more up-tp-date versions of the bash and zsh shells. Run this in 
the terminal emulator installed in the previous step (e.g. Iterm2).
```shell script
./setup_scripts/setup_shells.sh
```
Here I'm using a bare [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/) configuration with a 
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. You can consider other frameworks, such as:
- [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) - The configuration framework for Zsh
- [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) - Ultra-flexible and fast Zsh plugin manager with clean fpath, 
reports, completion management, Turbo, annexes, services, packages.
- [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) - ðŸŒº A next-generation plugin manager for zsh
- [antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) - The fastest shell plugin manager.

#### Shell Startup Files
Create symlinks to your startup scripts. **Warning: this will overwrite any existing files under the same 
path.**
```shell script
ln -shfv "$(realpath .zshenv)" ~
ln -shfv "$(realpath .zshrc)" ~
```
The rules that define whether a startup script gets sources (and in which order) differs depending on which
UNIX shell, type of initialization, and even operating system... If you have been following these 
installations steps, you are on a macOS machine and using the zsh Unix Shell. So here are some simple 
examples.
- When opening a new terminal shell (on iTerm2 or Terminal) the following files get sources
  `.zshenv --> .zprofile --> .zshrc --> .zlogin`. You are now using an interactive login shell. Once you kill
  the current shell the `.zlogout` script will be sourced before killing the process.
- If you source a script (e.g. `source some_script` or `. ./some_script`), no startup files get sourced. 
  This is because `source` reads and executes the contents of your script in the current shell environment.
- If you run a script as an executable, the script will run in an **new shell**. By default, and in most 
  cases, this will be a non-interactive non-login shell and, therefore, will only source `.zshenv` before 
  executing the script. You can extend this logic _ad infinitum_... if script calls yet another script, 
  which in turn calls yet again another script, etc, etc... each one will run in a new shell. Here I'm 
  assuming that the script will be executed within a zsh shell of course! If script contains a 
  `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` shebang line, it can be executed directly as `./some_script` or called as a regular 
  command if it exists under `$PATH`. Alternatively you can explicitly execute the script as 
  `zsh some_script`.

#### Install CLI and dev tools
Have a look inside this script to see what will be installed...
```shell script
./setup_scripts/cli_and_dev_tools.zsh
```

#### Install Python Development Tools
I use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage my python versions. Then 
[pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) and [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage
virtual environments. The following script will install your whole python development environment. To check 
which python versions will be installed run `echo "$PYENV_TARGET_VERSIONS`. You can pass either the exact 
patch version, or the minor version (in which case the latest patch will be installed).
- Install with the default versions `"$PYENV_TARGET_VERSIONS`
    ```shell script
    ./setup_scripts/python_dev_environment.zsh
    ```
- Pass your own versions
    ```shell script
    PYENV_TARGET_VERSIONS_OVERWRITE="3.7 3.8.5" ./setup_scripts/python_dev_environment.zsh
    ```


### Update general macOS preferences
This will update many of the default macos settings and system preferences. **Warning: It's recommended to 
reboot your machine after updating many of these preferences.** For convenience, this script will prompt you 
for an automatic reboot at the end ðŸ’ª
```shell script
./setup_scripts/macos.sh
```
From the [macOS User Guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh35890/mac), you have the option 
to add a message on the Mac login window. It can be used _"to provide contact information for a misplaced 
computer."_ 
```shell script
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText "If lost, please contact your_email_here@example.com"
```


### Install desktop applications
Have a look inside this script to see what will be installed...
```shell script
./setup_scripts/desktop_apps.zsh
```

#### Migrate app settings and system preferences

App settings:
1. Migrate all relevant config directories from `~/Library/Application\ Support`
2. Migrate all relevant app preferences from `~/Library/Preferences/`

### Update everything
**Note that, if needed, the first command will automatically restart your machine!**
```shell script
sudo softwareupdate --install --all --verbose --force --restart
```

Update any packages installed with brew
```shell script
brew update
brew upgrade
brew cask upgrade --greedy
brew cleanup
```


### Check for issues
Run `brew doctor` to check for any hanging issues
```shell script
brew doctor
```
