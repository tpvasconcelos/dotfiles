# My dotfiles


## Steps


### Clone this repository
Clone this repository under `~/.dotfiles`
```shell script
mkdir ~/.dotfiles && \
  cd ~/.dotfiles && \
  git clone https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/dotfiles.git .
```


### Install Xcode and Command Line Developer Tools
1. Start by downloading Xcode from the App Store. Once this download is complete, run the following shell 
commands from the Terminal app.
1. Here, we will install the Command Line Developer Tools. Note that the first command ensures 
`xcode-select` is pointing to the correct (active) developer directory. Follow the installation steps that 
will open in a user interface dialog.
    ```shell script
    sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
    xcode-select --install
    ```
1. As a final step, you'll need to accept the Xcode and SDK license agreements. The second command will also
install any missing packages.
    ```shell script
    sudo xcodebuild -license accept
    sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
    ```
1. This command will install all pending software updates for your machine. **Note that, if needed, this 
command will automatically restart your machine!**
    ```shell script
    sudo softwareupdate --install --all --verbose --force --restart
    ```


### Install Homebrew (brew)
```shell script
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew update && brew upgrade
```


### Install iTerm2
After installing iTerm2, you can switch to using the iTerm2 terminal emulater as oposed to Apple's Terminal 
app
```shell script
brew cask install iterm2
killall cfprefsd
# Migrate iTerm settings
cp settings/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/Library/Preferences
# Download Shell Integration script
curl -L https://iterm2.com/shell_integration/zsh -o ~/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh
```

Alternatives:
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - A cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator


### Upgrade and configure shells
This script will install and configure more up-tp-date versions of the bash and zsh shells. Run this in 
the Iterm2 app installed in the previous step.
```shell script
./setup_scripts/setup_shells.sh
```

Create symlinks to your config files. **Warning: this will overwrite any existing config files.**
```shell script
ln -shfv "$(realpath .zshrc)" ~
ln -shfv "$(realpath .p10k.zsh)" ~
```

Here I'm using a bare [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/) configuration with a 
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. You can consider other frameworks, such as:
- [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) - The configuration framework for Zsh
- [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) - Ultra-flexible and fast Zsh plugin manager with clean fpath, 
reports, completion management, Turbo, annexes, services, packages.
- [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) - ðŸŒº A next-generation plugin manager for zsh
- [antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) - The fastest shell plugin manager.
